#### Structural. Adapter pattern in C#.

The Adapter design pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.

This pattern can be used in various scenarios, such as integrating legacy code or third-party libraries with your application's code. Below is a real-world example of using the Adapter pattern in a .NET Core application.

##### Example Scenario:

Suppose you have a third-party logging library that you want to integrate into your .NET Core application. This library has a different interface than the logging interface your application uses.
